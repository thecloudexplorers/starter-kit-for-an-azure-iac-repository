# Purpose

This folder contains IaC files that are used as a unit of code reuse. A module file can contain a
single resource or set of resources, and can be called from controllers. This allows deployments to
be constructed from small, manageable components, and to reuse common pieces.

For the purposes of traceability and discoverability, each module is organized in a folder structure
that aligns with the [Azure Resource Provider](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ zure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types)
structure. An additional advantage of this approach is that the required `Azure Resource Providers`
are immediately visible. Furthermore, automation can be established to manage any drift in the
 providers, based on the modules.\
The module folder contains two subfolders: `samples` and `test`. The `samples` folder contains a
script and if required configuration that can be used to deploy the module locally. The `test`
folder contains all the test related materials. For example a unit test and scenario specific
 parameter files that can be used to test the module. In addition the folder contains a `readme.md`
file that describes the module and its usage. The module itself is typically named deploy but can be
named differently.
