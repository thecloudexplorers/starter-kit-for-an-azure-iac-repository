# Purpose

This folder contains IaC files that are used as controllers or orchestrators. Meaning scripts which
are intended to utilize one or more modules to deploy resources.

Each controller is placed in a similar named folder. The folder contains two subfolders: `📂samples`
and `📂test`. The `📂samples` folder contains a script and if required configuration that can be
used to deploy the controller locally. The `📂test` folder contains all the test related materials.
For example a unit test and scenario specific parameter files that can be used to test the
controller. In addition the folder contains a `📜readme.md` file that describes the controller and
its usage.
The module itself is typically named equally to the folder but based on preference can be named
differently.
